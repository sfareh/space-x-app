If you want to contribute to a project and make it better, your help is very welcome.

### How to make a clean pull request

- Create a personal fork of this project on your Github
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`
- Create a new branch to work on! 
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation
- Add or change the documentation as needed
- If the project has tests run them
- Write or adapt tests as needed
- Squash your commits into a single commit with git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase). Create a new branch if necessary
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `main` branch
-  If I request further changes just push them to your branch. The PR will be updated automatically
-  Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete
your extra branch(es)
